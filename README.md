# Memorize2020
My version of CS193p Spring 2020

This project contains a version of Memorize for CS193p Spring 2020 based on the youtube videos. 

The code differs slightly from the lecture, and comments are a bit more liberal, including notes that help
reason though the lessons.

File organization is rather different than presented, with liberal use of Group folders.
